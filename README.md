# Solidity Smart Contracts

This folder contains a collection of simple smart contracts written in Solidity. Each contract is self-contained and demonstrates fundamental blockchain functionalities.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **Solidity Compiler**: Ensure you have a Solidity compiler installed. You can use:
  - [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/): A web-based IDE for compiling and testing Solidity contracts.
  - [solc](https://soliditylang.org/install/): A command-line compiler for Solidity.

2. Compile the contract.
3. Deploy it to a local or test blockchain (e.g., Ganache or Ethereum testnets like Goerli).
